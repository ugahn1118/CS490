CS490 Project: Online Exam Application Project for testing login ucid:instructor, ucid:student, password:12345

Designed and developed the application using Model View Controller architecture structured as a three-tiered client-server system. Front-middle-back

Developed an online exam system. The exam system will deal with only one type of question - open ended programming questions of the form: "Write a method named calcSomthing that takes parameters named a and b of type int, calculates (whatever), and returns the appropriate value." You may choose either Java or Python as your language and assume questions will be of the level appropriate for a course similar to CS 100 or CS 113.

Fully functional system supporting four use-cases:

1.Instructor may add questions to a question bank.
2.Instructor may select questions from the question bank to create an exam.
3.Student may take exam, and (after Intructor releases scores).
4.Student may check exam score and feedback.
